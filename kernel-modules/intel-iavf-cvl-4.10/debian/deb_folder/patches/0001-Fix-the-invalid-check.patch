Subject: [PATCH] Fix the invalid check in iavf_remove()

If the netdev pointer is NULL, then iavf_remove() returns early to
ensure that it does not proceed with an already-freed netdev instance.
However, drvdata field of the iavf driver's pci_dev structure continues
to keep the former value of the netdev pointer, and this value can be
acquired from the pci_dev structure via pci_get_drvdata(). This causes a
kernel panic when a forced reboot/shutdown is in progress due to the
following sequence of events:

- The iavf_shutdown() callback is called by the kernel. This function
  detaches the device, brings it down if it was running and frees
  resources.
- Later, the associated PF driver's shutdown callback is called:
  ice_shutdown(). That callback calls, among others, sriov_disable(),
  which then indirectly calls iavf_remove() again.
- Kernel WARNING is reported because the work adminq_task->func is NULL
  in cancel_work_sync(&adapter->adminq_task) during iavf_remove(), that
  reason is the resource already had been freed in the first iavf_remove()
  running stage.
  "WARNING: CPU: 63 PID: 93678 at kernel/workqueue.c:3047
    __flush_work.isra.0+0x6b/0x80"

The patch for iavf resolves this issue by checking the pci_dev
structure's is_busmaster field at the beginning of iavf_remove(). If the
PCI device had already been disabled by an earlier call to
iavf_shutdown() or iavf_remove(), via a call to pci_disable_device(),
then the is_busmaster field would be set to zero. Based on this logic,
if the is_busmaster field is set to zero, then the iavf_remove function
returns early. This in turn avoids the aforementioned kernel panic
caused by multiple calls to iavf_remove().

Reproducer:
1. Create container with VF on PF driven by ice.
2. Ensure that the VF is bound to iavf driver
3. Reboot -f
